# Mitochondria
## Goal: 
AI Informed, Free-to-Consume, High Quality Education.

If the government can print money to bail out banks, 
then we can print money to create high quality education.

# Mitochondria Tokenomics
This project is powered by $MITY, an ERC20 token.
On launch, a $MITY can be purchased for 0.03089294 ETH, where it stays in your wallet.

After launch, its value will be driven by:
1) The perceived quality and impact of the educational resources it supports
2) Its utility within the platform
3) The growth of the Mitochondria ecosystem

A 10% Purchasers Fee on all purchased $MITY goes to the DAO treasury, 10% of the Purchaser Fee goes to the founders wallet.
I just can't have people whaling about.
Given that the token is backed by education, use of the education, and demand for the education, the value trajectory is positive.

# Quality Assurance
There is no demand for individuals who can spit out definitions on demand.
Memorizing information does not mean you know how to use it, or advance it.

I propose a new learning model that must cover the learning cycle:
Experience (problem identified) > Philosophy (what is the nature of the problem?) > Theory (here's how I would go about solving it) > Implementation (the empirical nitty-gritty) > Experience (restart cycle).
This provides a framework for education that is not just about what to learn, but how to learn and how to think. 
It instills skills that are essential for navigating a complex and ever-changing world.
It removes dependence on AI to solve the problems, and instead leaves AI to hammer out implementation of the devised solutions.

## If your course can teach me the philosophy and how that translates into theory and then implementation, *that* is high quality education.

# Bounties
A Bounty is created when a proposal for a new education domain is submitted.
The bounty is equal to 25% of the staked tokens, and is paid out over the creation of the curriculum, milestone based.
The staking member is purchasing Vote tokens from the DAO with that 25%, those are used later.
The Bounty outlines what knowledge gaps the curriculum needs to teach, the DAO defines milestones verifies the completions are of Quality.
Bounties cannot be edited once submitted, if you identify more gaps, you must propose a new bounty.

## Implementation Plan
An Implementation Plan is submitted to a Bounty, it outlines a proposed curriculum and how it will be taught.
When the first Implementation Plan is submitted, there is a 30 day period to allow for competing Implementations to emerge.
After the 30 days, the Implementation plan with the most votes by staked token holders receives the bounty.

## How do I get paid though
Milestones are determined in your curriculum creation, and you are paid per milestone.
Implementation Plans lay out milestones of completion, and what triggers it, which creates an instance of payment.
This means we need an Empirical standard of quality for education, which I have yet to define.
The bounty is spread across all these instances, so go crazy.

After the curriculum is published, token holders can access it, and earn a soulbound certification that says "this wallet completed a course by this educator" upon completion.
Whenever a bounty is completed by a student inside that domain (took an agriculture course, completed a bounty for building a planting bed), the Teacher gets a kickback.
I would also like them to be paid based on how well their students interact tests (standardized testing, but like projects, not tests).
Student project grades will be based on: understanding of how to tackle the problem, flexibility in doing so, and effectiveness of the solution.

# Governance cycle:
1) A gap in education is identified
2) Token holder initiates proposal
3) Implementation Plan submitted
4) Vote is held 30 days later
5) Winner builds the content, sustaining themselves on bounty payments
6) Students learn and complete the curriculum.

# STAGE 2
Now that there is a platform where token holders can propose bounties, AND there are highly educated individuals inside the network, we now have a Radiative Distributed Specialization of individuals (since everyone is specialized in their own thing, the collective is generalist).
