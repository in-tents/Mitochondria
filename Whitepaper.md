# Project Mitochondria
### Goal: 
AI Informed, Free-to-Consume, High Quality Education.

# Mitochondria Finances
This project is powered by donations.

# Quality Assurance
There is no desire for individuals who can spit out definitions on demand.

Memorizing information does not mean you know how to use it, or advance it.

### FAFO Education Model
I propose a new learning model based on how information is actually discovered:

Experience (problem identified) > Philosophy (what is the nature of the problem?) > Theory (here's how I would go about solving it) > Implementation (the empirical nitty-gritty) > Experience (restart cycle).

This provides a framework for education that is not just about what to learn, but how to learn and how to think. 

It instills skills that are essential for navigating a complex and ever-changing world.

It removes dependence on AI to solve the problems, and instead leaves AI to hammer out implementation of devised solutions.

Courses will be sorted by Philosophy, Theory, or Implementation. Ideally they are created with this in mind.

In order to recieve a certification of completion, the student must solve a real world problem using what they have learned.

# Bounties
A Bounty is created when a proposal for a new education module is submitted by the DAO or a Third Party.

The Bounty outlines what knowledge gaps the curriculum needs to teach, defines milestones. 

Quality verification will be carried out by platform staff, and the staff is human so this takes time.

### Implementation Plan
Submitted to a Bounty, it outlines a proposed curriculum and how it will be taught.

When the first Implementation Plan is submitted, there is a 30 day period to allow for complementary Implementations to emerge while donor interest is hot.

After the 30 days, the Implementation plans that recieve donations can either complete the bounty or refund the donations.

Only those who care and are informed enough will vote, but everyone *can* vote.

Note: submitting a bounty and then an implementation plan to that same bounty is acceptable and encrouaged, but may not find donations.

## How do I get paid though
### Initial Funding
Bounties define the gaps in the education, the bounty payment is split across each course module completed, as long as they are of Quality.

This means we need an Empirical standard of quality for education, which I have yet to define. Perhaps based on depth, ease of consumption, and quality of production. But that's not empirical. Perhaps the educators and Vis floris grade it via rubric, and then we take the average. But AGAIN *what am I measuring*.

Ideally if you do even better, the DAO is able to tip you. But i dunno we don't make money around these parts.

# Who gets to access this education?
After the curriculum is published, any member of the platform can access it, as well as recieve a certificate with a unique QR code that will make sense much later.

Student project grades will be based on: understanding of how to tackle the problem, flexibility in doing so, and effectiveness of the solution.

### Pro-Whale
We love whales, they fund our projects, but we don't love it when they absorb a lot of power.

What I propose is the Elite Lie, which essentially hammers out a path to Cosmetic Influence.

You get your name on the project, you can show it off, no one needs to know that all you did was fund it, and everyone who does is very grateful.
