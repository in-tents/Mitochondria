# **Project Mitochondria**

**AI-Informed, Free-to-Consume, High-Quality Education**

---

### **1. Executive Summary**

Project Mitochondria is a community-powered educational initiative designed to deliver free, high-quality, and practical learning experiences. Powered by donations and guided by a new “FAFO” learning model, the project equips learners not just to *know* but to *apply* knowledge in solving real-world problems.

This is not about memorization, definitions, or passive learning. Project Mitochondria fosters curiosity, critical thinking, and adaptive problem-solving—skills essential for navigating a complex, rapidly evolving world.

### **2. Mission & Vision**

**Mission:**
To create an open, AI-informed learning ecosystem where education is accessible to all and anchored in real-world problem-solving.

**Vision:**
A global network of learners who are able to think critically, design creative solutions, and leverage AI as a supportive tool—not a crutch—for innovation.

### **3. The FAFO Learning Model**

Traditional education often stops at rote learning. Project Mitochondria introduces the **FAFO Cycle**:

1. **Experience** – Identify a problem through lived experience or observation.
2. **Philosophy** – Define the nature of the problem and its broader implications.
3. **Theory** – Develop hypotheses and proposed solutions.
4. **Implementation** – Execute the solution, leveraging empirical methods and AI support where appropriate.
5. **Experience (Again)** – Evaluate outcomes, refine the process, and begin the cycle anew.

This model emphasizes **how to think, not just what to think**, enabling learners to confidently tackle novel challenges without over-reliance on AI-generated answers.

**Course Categorization:**

* **Philosophy** – Understanding the “why” behind a problem.
* **Theory** – Mapping out possible solutions.
* **Implementation** – Building and testing solutions.

**Certification Requirement:**
Learners must complete a real-world problem-solving project to earn certification.

### **4. Bounty System: Funding & Content Creation**

Project Mitochondria’s content creation is driven by a **Bounty System**:

* **Bounty Creation** – A bounty is posted when the Project or a third party identifies a knowledge gap and outlines required learning outcomes.
* **Implementation Plans** – Educators submit plans detailing the curriculum and teaching approach. A 10-day open period allows for multiple proposals before donors commit.
* **Donor Support** – Interested donors fund the proposals they believe in.
* **Quality Verification** – Mitochondria staff review submissions based on:

  * Depth of Knowledge
  * Ease of Consumption
  * Production Quality
  * Real-World Application
  * Alignment with the FAFO model

---

### **5. Payment & Incentives for Creators**

**Initial Funding:**

* Bounty funds are distributed across completed modules that meet quality standards.
* Mitochondria staff score each submission using a transparent rubric.
* Exceptional work may receive additional tips from the Mitochondria (budget permitting).

**Creator Encouragement:**
Submitting both a bounty proposal and an implementation plan is allowed—and encouraged. However, funding depends on donor interest.

---

### **6. Accessibility & Certification**

Once published, all courses are free to access.
Certificates include a **unique QR code** for verification and future platform-integrated functionality.

**Student Assessment:**

* Problem identification & framing
* Adaptability in approach
* Effectiveness of the implemented solution

---

### **7. Governance & Influence**

**Pro-Whale Policy:**
We welcome large donors ("whales") while maintaining decentralization. Our **Elite Lie** policy offers high-visibility recognition without granting disproportionate control:

* Donors’ names are featured on the project.
* Their contributions are publicly celebrated.
* Influence over curriculum remains with the Mitochondria and community.

---

### **8. Financial Sustainability**

* **Revenue Model:** Primarily donation-based, with possible future integration of optional premium tools, Mitochondria memberships, or sponsor partnerships.
* **Expense Allocation:** Creator payments, platform maintenance, quality assurance, and Mitochondria operations.

---

### **9. Roadmap**

**Phase 1 – Launch Infrastructure**

* Finalize Mitochondria governance
* Implement bounty posting and submission platform
* Develop and test FAFO-aligned rubric

**Phase 2 – First Wave of Content**

* Post initial bounties
* Recruit and fund first educators
* Release first certified courses

**Phase 3 – Scale & Refine**

* Expand bounty categories
* Introduce advanced certifications
* Integrate AI-assisted but human-led grading tools

---

### **10. Stage 2 Teaser**

We now have a Radiative Distributed Specialization of individuals (since everyone is specialized in their own thing, the collective is generalist).

We have a platform where individuals can post bounties for tasks, and highly educated individuals who can complete those tasks.

Something like that can achieve Solarpunk, given enough time, resources, and love.
